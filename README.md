# jeckes-finder

An attempt of creating a pipeline for information extraction and matching from the Mitteilungsblatt (and hopefully other German Jewish Newspapers), and names from the Archive of German speaking Jews in Israel.
  
* Preliminary Resources
1. JeckeArchivNames: 478 names of people from the folder titles of the Jecke Archives. Each Person has a German and a Hebrew name, and their concatenation as Unique Id's. 
  other names mentioned in the longer titles are not listed in this file.
2. uniqueAlla-zNamesfromJeckesdescriptions: additional names (in English only) extracted from the Hebrew descriptions of the folders in the catalog. Not including names that already appear in no.1 . Additional columns include the original appearance of the name (e.g. with title) and name structure.
