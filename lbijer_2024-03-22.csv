The letter is written on the 20.04.1909 and has a letterhead from the Direktion der Freuen Schulgemeine Wickersdorf (Chief of the Free School Community Wickersdorf). In the letter Gustav Wyneken is talking about the reform of school institution towards a school system which is based on humanity and explains his views about the studies to become a teacher. He emphasizes that those studies are not sufficient to find out what the goal and the means of modern education are. He explains his method of working with the youth inside his school and it seems so if Gustav Wyneken is offering the addressee an employment as a teacher. For this aspect also counts the mentioning of a salary in the Postscript. Furthermore he refers to the yearbook and the annual report of his school in which the addressee could find the explanation of the principles of Gustav Wyneke's new way of education. In addition to that he gives the addressee several advices on teaching and the way he or she should built a community for people who are interested in modern education.","\\$aGustav Wynecken was a German non-Jewish educational reformer and leader of a reform school in Tueringen in Germany. In his reform pedagogical project he wanted to educate the youth on the basis of a 'Weltanschauung' (world view). Furthermore he especially emphasized that there was a need for a new relationship between the teacher and the student. He established coeducation of boys and girls in his school and also sexuality education. Moreover he introduced his students to the ideas of democracy through their own participation in decision making in the school. Wyneken also influenced Jewish youth movements in Poland and Vienna (such as 'Hashomer Hatzair'), and had some influence on the early Kibbutz education in Israel. He is also known to have influenced the circle around Stefan George; Bruno Bettelheim; and Pier Paolo Pasolini's school in Casarsa, as well as Pasolini's later teaching. Wyneken had himself been influenced by the thinking of Martin Buber and Hermann Lietz, and also the Hebrew educational tradition, in which a good education is founded on a teacher's love for his students. The young Walter Benjamin's political aesthetics were greatly influenced by a stay (1905-1907) at a Wyneken boarding school (Haubinda in Thüringen) where he became close to Wyneken. He was also influenced by the Wyneken-edited radical youth journal 'Der Anfang' ('The Beginning'). Wyneken's ideal (was) of an elite and highly ethical Männerbund devoted to the ideals of Kant, Hegel, Goethe and Nietzsche. (Rabinbach, 1985). However, when Gustav Wyneken gave a broadly pro-war speech in Munich in November 1914, the pacifist Benjamin reluctantly broke with his mentor. In 1920 Wyneken was forced to resign as leader of the Free School Community amidst allegations of homosexual relations with two students. Subsequently he was indicted of committing vice with minors and convicted in 1921. He died on the 8th December in Göttingen i",,,"\0$aReformatories.;\0$aYouth movement$zGermany.;\0$aEducation$zGermany$xPhilosophy.","\7$aWickersdorf‏$gSaalfelder Höhe$2VIAF","\7$aArchival Collections","\\$aLBI Jerusalem Archives","41$aDigital form$uhttp://digipres.cjh.org:1801/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE10045417"

At the age of 18 he moved to Prague. The first 20 pages of his diary describe a period of six years during which he suffered poverty and homesickness. With the encouragement of his family he requested and gained a salary raise from his employer, which led to an improvement in his financial status and enabled him to purchase some clothes. He fell in love in with his neigbor Pauline (born 1846) and offered her marriage but she refused. He then changed jobs and started to work at Locke's textile factory in Prague. Besides his hard work, Vogl describes the following three years as a period during which he flourished. He saved money, was able to assist his mother and sister.

She was forced to leave the university in 1933 and began to work for various Jewish journals. In 1934 she published her first collection of poems (Im Vers gefangen) under a pseudonym. A year later, in 1935, her first volume of poems under her real name (Dreiklang. Worte vor Gott, von Liebe, vom Tag) was published. The book was later banned because it referred to the problems that beset the Jewish population in Germany at the time. After Marx migrated to New York via Prague in 1938, the US German Jewish magazine Aufbau published several of her poems. In 1951 her last collection of poems (Bericht) appeared.

Only individuals aged over 64 and those who were unable to emigrate for other reasons remained. Most of them wished to live in the seniors home and therefore handed all their assets to the Aschenheim foundation. The home was thus accumulating capital and in 1939 the remaining heads of the community devised a plan to move the entire home with its residents out of Danzig, since this was financially feasible. They made contact with a Sephardic community in Bayonne in Biarritz, which was willing to take the seniors home into their community. This plan failed since the French Interior Ministry refused to approve it. The letter addressed to the chairman of the Jewish Community in Tel Aviv is probably one of many that the administration of the home sent out to institutions and bodies in the hope that they would provide assistance. In the autumn of the same year the home had to be evacuated because of the construction of a new Nazi building complex. The home moved to Milchkannenstrasse 25-26 and on September 1, 1939 it housed 130 residents. From 1940 onward the home was overcrowded on account of the housing shortage for Jewish people in Danzig.

It is likely that this report was drafted from the testimonies of passengers delivered to a police investigation against the crew of the ship. The report not only describes the overall difficulty of landing the ship in Palestine, but emphasizes mainly the mistreatment of the passengers by the crew and the generally sorry situation on board. The voyage was organized by the Warsaw branch of the revisionist Zionist group Beitar, which took over the leadership of the ship. The passengers of the Astir comprised a large group of around 700 refugees from Danzig, and a group of 200 Beitar members from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. The ship left Romania on the March 6, 1939 and sailed via Varna and Samos to Haifa, where it arrived on April 4, 1939. However, it did not received permission to dock in Haifa and was forced to sail to Lawrio on April 10. The ship was then adrift in the sea off Greece for some weeks before it attempted to land again in Palestine on June 28 near Asheklon.",,,"20$aBetar.","\0$aJewish refugees.;\0$aAliyah.;\0$aHolocaust, Jewish (1939-1945);\0$aAliyah.","\0$aDanzig (Germany);\0$aReni (Oblast Odessa)$2VIAF","\7$aManuscripts$2cjh","\\$aLBI Jerusalem Archives","41$aDigital form$uhttps://digipres.cjh.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE10261626"

The majority of the collection is in a good condition and is legible.

Lisl - called Elisabette Silberberg before she was married and then subsequently changed her surname to Aron - was married to Julian Aron and they had at least one child, called Tirza, who donated the collection. Included in the collection is a marriage certificate between Julian and Lisl Aron - the two were married in Ramat Gan in 1933 when Julian was 29 years old and Lisl was 24 years old, although the certificate itself was issued in 1937. Lisl´s sister, Annalise was in a relationship with Hans and together they had at least one child called Sippi. Alongside the letters and marriage certificate, there are 56 written pages of a diary by Julian Aron from 1931-48. The writings describe Julian´s first impressions of Israel (he made aliyah from Vienna in 1930) and reflections on his identity as a chalutz (pioneer). Julian mentions figures from Vienna such as Zwi Perez Chajes and he writes about preparations for the first Maccabiah games in 1932. There is a break in the writing from 1931-1939, and Julian begins to write more sporadically during the war years (writing only 2-3 times a year) and also writes about his family, particularly about his daughter Tirza, who donated the collection.

After the war he became active in Jewish communal life in Cologne, and was a member of the community board, and of the Israelitisches Asyl für Kranke und Altersschwache. The inflation of the 1920s and the Nazis' subsequent rise to power badly affected his company and he was forced to sell it.

In 1923, she was accepted to study Humanities, exhibited in a letter authorised by the Prussian Minister for Science, Art and Education. The letter was written in 1928 and mentions that she was accepted to study despite not finishing her final school exams - this is perhaps because the Prussian Minister did not accept her Reifenzeugnis exams due to her completing them at an all girls school, and the letter was possibly written in 1928 (despite her attending the University in 1923) because the University would not accept female students formally unless they proved they could write good enough papers at which point they would then be retroactively accepted by the University once they had completed their work. From 1926-27, Guezberger worked as a Literature teacher at a school in Lötnik, an area just outside Dresden. In 1933, Guezberger received her doctorate in Dutch, French and Philosophy in 1933 in a paper called ""Stileigenheiten Der Romantik"" at the University of Bonn, in Germany. Subsequent to this, Guezberger attended the Nancy-Universtity from 1934-37, completing numerous degrees.

The family planned to travel to the USA via Portugal, so they drove to France and lived in an old house for a while, but eventually decided to return to Belgium, where they lived on a farm.

In Nice he attended school, and in 1942 a teacher helped the family obtain a forged visa to enter Switzerland. They fled to Geneva illegally and reached a refugee camp in St. Gallen.

In his spare time Ezra helped his mother and was able to work as a cook in a hotel. Once the war was over his parents worked as translators, and he was sent to school in Geneva. When Ezra turned 18 he had to leave Switzerland. He became familiar with Zionism and in 1947 decided to migrate to Palestine.

Although she trained to work in a kindergarten, she was turned down by all the places she applied to and ""wouldn't have found a place to work,"" as she says. She ended up in a Jewish school but left Austria legally by ship in September 1938. Her elder sister migrated to America, and her brother joined a Hachshara on a kibbutz in Palestine. Tirza's younger brother remained in Vienna before migrating to Paris, where he met his wife who came from Czernowitz, Romania. Her father, who was an active Zionist, managed to obtain a certificate and reached Trieste on September 1, 1939, on route to Palestine.

After these events, Alice left for Brussels on a Kindertransport, and her parents joined her after crossing the border illegally. However, after the war broke out all migrants had to leave the country, and the family was dispersed among various French concentration camps. Alice was detained in the camp of Rivesaltes. Her father, who was in Saint-Cyprien, fled to Lyon, where his sister lived, and wrote to Alice and her mother telling them to join him there. From there, the family tried to reach Switzerland, but they were turned back at the border and arrested by German soldiers, who returned them to Paris. Alice was placed in an orphanage and never saw her parents again, as they were subsequently deported to Auschwitz. After a few months Alice managed to leave the orphanage and returned to Lyon.

The group, which numbered approximately 400 young people, was forced to wait for a year since their ship was not ready. Eventually they embarked on May 20, 1940 and set sail along the Danube. The police stopped them in a small city near Budapest, and 100 older people released from Buchenwald concentration camp joined them on the ship. The ship remained on the Danube for six months until the passengers collected sufficient money to obtain permission to cross Rumania. When the ship reached the Black sea it capsized, and the passengers were stranded on an island in the Aegean Sea. After ten days, in March 1942, they were apprehended by Italian soldiers and sent to the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp in Italy. Akiva relates that the living conditions there were far better than those in the camps in other countries; he managed to find a job there and got married in the camp, from which the group was released after a year.

After a year-long journey the boat reached Haifa, but the passengers were not allowed to disembark by the British authorities. The Rieglers remained on the boat and the Haganah placed a bomb in it to prevent it from moving any further. Unfortunately, the bomb exploded, leaving several people dead and injured, among them a friend of Ruth's, whom she had met during the voyage. The family received help and was allowed to disembark. Later, they would learn that five out of Ruth's father's six brothers and sisters were deported, and that her grandfather had been sent to Buchenwald. Ruth remained in Israel where she married twice.

The family was secular, but aside from the children at school Schifra had mostly Jewish friends. At a certain point, the other children at school began to ignore her; ""They treated me as if I was air,"" she remarked. She remained -at school until the end of the school year in 1938. Her parents decided that it was time to leave. At the time, Schifra was a member of the Noar Zion Zionist Youth movement, where she learned about Palestine; and in the synagogue she was able to learn a little Hebrew. Through a friend at a different Jewish youth movement she applied for a certificate to enter Palestine. When she was finally able to leave, she had mixed feelings about it. While it was hard for her to leave her parents and sister behind, she felt curious about what awaited her. On January 2, 1939, she boarded a train to Trieste, and from there embarked on a ship to Tel-Aviv. In Palestine, she lived with a foster family; while she spoke German, her foster parents spoke Yiddish. Back in Austria, Schifra's father searched for a way for the rest of the family to flee. He traveled to Prague to that end, and was apprehended there when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia. He fled to Poland and from Poland to Russia, and survived the war. He migrated to Palestine and owned a store in Acre. Shifra's mother and sister remained in Vienna, waiting for permits that would enable them to leave.

Susanne relates that they were not surprised by the public enthusiasm in Austria for the Anschluss because she believes that the population had always been anti-Semitic and she experienced discrimination at school. Susanne's mother remained in Graz with her children up until November 9, 1938, when the Gestapo arrested her for a day. The mother and her children left Austria a few hours later with only ten marks in their pockets. They reached Italy, moved from one place to another, and eventually stayed in Venice until they received visas and left for Menton (France), to link up with Susanne's father and uncle. The father wanted to remain there, but her mother refused, arguing that the Gestapo had warned them: ""wherever you go, we'll come for you."" On March 13, 1939 the family set sail from Marseilles for Haifa. By insisting that they leave France, Susanne says, her mother saved her life for the second time.

The couple traveled to Linz together in 1932-33, returning to Palestine after the Anschluss.

Micha moved to a different kibbutz, and was sent to Jerusalem to work for the party's newspaper. This experience enabled him to find employment with Israel's state broadcasting station and in 1964 he was one of five radio professionals to be sent abroad to study television. He worked at the BBC for a year but by the time he returned the government had decided against introducing television to Israel.

After the Anschluss, since the mother was Rumanian, they moved to Oradea in Transylvania, Rumania. However, a part of Transylvania was annexed to Hungary by Germany and the family thus once again came under German control. In 1943, when the family was living in Bucharest, Great Britain provided 75 certificates to children allowing them to migrate to Palestine. Menachem traveled on a Kindertransport, together with children who held Austrian and Russian passports. At the border, soldiers checked the passports of the children. Some of them carried false passports of South-American countries, and they were taken off the train and shot. The remaining children continued their journey through Bulgaria, Istanbul, and Syria until they reached Beirut.

Shmuel and his brother Menachem attended the Talmud Tora Jewish school for four years, and then moved to a public school.

He was an only child, and his father was a dentist. His earliest memory is from his family escape to Belgium in 1938; he remembers crossing the border in a car without his parents, who had to cross by foot. In 1939 his father obtained a visa to China at the consulate in Vienna, thanks to the help of a stranger. Robert and his family lived in Shanghai from 1939 until 1949. In 1941 the Japanese made them move to the Hongkew Ghetto. During his time in Shanghai, Robert attended the local Jewish Youth Association School, which he disliked as a child. However, in hindsight, he appreciates the quality education he received. On his way to school, he was oftentimes assaulted by Chinese and Russian people. The family lived in poverty; his father struggled to find a job, while his mother had to become a sex worker. Robert remembers the heavy bombing in 1945, which made the entire family homeless. From 1946 to 1949 the Americans controlled Shanghai, and the conditions improved.;\\$aIn 1949 the communists were approaching Shanghai, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee hired a cargo ship for Jews who wished to leave. Robert and his family arrived Israel this way, staying at first in a refugee camp near Hadera for three months and then moving to Safed. In Safed, Robert attended school for two years, despite not understanding Hebrew. At age 15, he left for a year to work at a Kibbutz, where he finally learned Hebrew. His parents stayed in Safed and never learned the language. Robert went on to serve in the army, where he was part of the paratroopers. He fought in two wars, one of them being the Sinai war. Later on, together with friends from the army, Robert joined Kibbutz Zikim, which is 3km away from the Gaza strip. There he worked as a music teacher and is now retired and an author.
